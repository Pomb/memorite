A simple command line application that accepts a text file, then prompts you for the next line from a couple options, until the file is complete.

--> call the app with the path to the document
--> show the last line, then prompt for the next line from 4 random options
--> correct or false
--> repeat until the document is complete
 

============== Thoughts =================

Two modes [TEST, LEARN]
- TEST
 - straight up write the text, line by line.
 - get feedback on correct lines / words as they entered
 - accuracy % correct words in lines
- LEARN
 - different types of multiple choice questions
  - pick correct line for next line
  - pick correct word for missing word in line
  - order the lines

Question track of X length -that satisfies the length of the lines- that randomly chooses a question type

Save attempts for the text file
